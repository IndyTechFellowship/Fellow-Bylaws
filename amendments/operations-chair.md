# Amendment: Operations Chair

**Proposed by**: Alex Correa, Chelsie Kasun, Ian Andrews, Kate Harrison, Mateusz Kosciuk, Mike Hockerman

**At**: June 2017 Monthly Meeting

**Seconded by**: TBD

**Ratification Vote At**: August 2017 Monthly Meeting

# Summary

The purpose of this amendment is to rename and reclassify the Finance Chair’s roles and responsibilities to that of an Operations Chair, who in addition to Financial matters will be responsible for assisting in day-to-day operations of the Fellowship, including organizing meeting space, managing attendance records, etc.

# Reasoning

Over the past year, we have learned a lot about which roles in leadership are under and over-provisioned. One thing we have discovered is that the Finance Chair’s responsibilities, while important, were often things that TechPoint manages for us, due to the intricacies of invoicing and funding. Additionally, we have come to appreciate Ian’s role in finding meeting space and times for leadership and monthly meetings, and believe there will be value in formalizing this role for future elections and classes.

# Impact Analysis

Initial analysis concludes that this change should have no major material impact on the day-to-day experience most Fellows have in the Fellowship. 
 
- The Finance chair will be reclassified as the Operations chair, with no election.
- The Operations chair will take on the additional responsibility of being a resource to anyone in the Fellowship who needs physical space reserved for a meeting, a meeting time organized, a calendar event planned, or anything else which can be classified as administrative and doesn’t strictly fall under the jurisdiction of another Chair.
- Due to elections proceeding in alphabetical order, the Operations Chair election portion will move from 4th to 5th place on election day, following Marketing.
