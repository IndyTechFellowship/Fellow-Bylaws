# Amendment: Alumni Relations Chair

**Proposed by**: Alex Correa, Chelsie Kasun, Ian Andrews, Kate Harrison, Mateusz Kosciuk, Mike Hockerman

**At**: July 2017 Monthly Meeting

**Seconded by**: TBD

**Ratification Vote At**: August 2017 Monthly Meeting

# Summary

The purpose of this amendment is to rename and reclassify the Capstone Experience Chair’s roles and responsibilities to that of an Alumni Relations Chair, who in addition to assisting in planning the capstone experience will be responsible for ensuring a positive relationship with Fellows as they graduate from the Fellowship.

# Reasoning

One of the Tech Fellowship’s primary pillars is to create the next-generation of leaders for central indiana. Pursuant to that pillar, the Fellowship desires to maintain a positive relationship with alumni of the program as people begin to graduate. This obviously has not been a consideration in any leadership planning given the lack of alumni, but as people graduate, someone will need to take on this role. Additionally, we have learned that TechPoint has the capacity to manage much of the tactical planning of the capstone experience, freeing up capacity for the capstone experience chair to take on this role.

# Impact Analysis

Initial analysis concludes that this change should have no major material impact on the day-to-day experience most Fellows have in the Fellowship. 
 
- The Capstone Experience chair will be reclassified as the Alumni Relations chair, with no election.
- The Alumni Relations chair will take on the additional responsibility of being a point-of-contact for alumni of the program, including planning alumni events and encouraging professional networking between alumni and current Tech Fellows.
