# Amendment: Remove Recruitment Chair

Proposed by: Mike Hockerman

At: February 2018 MM

Seconded by: Tylor Garrett

Ratification Vote At: March 2018 MM

# Summary

The role of Recruitment Chair is removed as an executive board position.

# Reasoning

At the time of this writing, recruitment for the Fellowship is frozen; there is no class of 2018, and while recruitment could begin again for a Class of 2019, there is no intention to do so at this time. Therefore, in preparation for the executive board elections in Q1 2018, it feels inappropriate to ask someone to take on this role. 

Should recruitment ever be unfrozen, an amendment can be motioned at that time to vote in someone to fill this role, at the discretion of the Fellowship at that time.

# Impact Analysis

- The executive board will be reduced to six members, which could result in stalemate votes that will need to be broken by a TechPoint representative. 
- The outgoing Recruitment Chair, Tylor Garrett, will remain on the Executive Board in an advisory capacity during the transition period between the 2016 and 2017 Executive Boards, taking on the fictious role of Chief Problem Solver.
